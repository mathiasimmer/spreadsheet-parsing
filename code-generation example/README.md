This folder contains all the necessary files to get a code-generation example up and running. All .gs files are essentially JavaScript files that are Google Apps Script compatible.

Questioniare.csv contains an example of a spreadsheet. It should be imported into Google Sheets.
Once imported, go to Tools -> Script Editor. Follow the instructions and choose an arbitrary name for the script. All .gs and .html files should be created in the script editor.
The content of QuestionaireGenerator.sglg can be pasted into the code-generation editor which can be invoked from the menu Worksheet Validation -> Code generation editor.
